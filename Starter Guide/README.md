# OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls
https://top10proactive.owasp.org/

"The goal of the OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls project is to raise awareness about application security by describing the most important areas of concern that software developers must be aware of. We encourage you to use the OWASP Proactive Controls to get your developers started with application security. Developers can learn from the mistakes of other organizations."
"This document should be seen as a starting point rather than a comprehensive set of techniques and practices. We want to again emphasize that this document is intended to provide initial awareness around building secure software."

# OWASP Top 10 - 2021
https://owasp.org/Top10/

"The OWASP Top 10 is the reference standard for the most critical web application security risks. Adopting the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing your software development culture focused on producing secure code."
"The OWASP Top 10 is primarily an awareness document. However, this has not stopped organizations from using it as a de facto industry AppSec standard since its inception in 2003. If you want to use the OWASP Top 10 as a coding or testing standard, know that it is the bare minimum and just a starting point."
