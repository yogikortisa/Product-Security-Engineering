# OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)
The structure folder uses the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) (https://owaspsamm.org/about/) to simplify and standardize the areas for each phase of Secure SDLC.
The maturity framework answered the "What", for the "How" to implement you can see the "Stream Guidance" part on every security activitiy's stream.

## The SAMM Model Overview
| Business Functions | Security Practices       |  
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |  
| Governance           | Strategy & Metrics        |  
| Governance           | Policy & Compliance       |  
| Governance           | Education & Guidance      |  
| Design               | Threat Assessment         |  
| Design               | Security Requirements      |  
| Design               | Secure Architecture       |  
| Implementation       | Secure Build              |  
| Implementation       | Secure Deployment         |  
| Implementation       | Defect Management         |  
| Verification         | Architecture Assessment   |  
| Verification         | Requirements Testing      |  
| Verification         | Security Testing          |  
| Operations           | Incident Management       |  
| Operations           | Environment Management    |

# A Lightweight Approach To Implement Secure Software Development LifeCycle (Secure SDLC)

OWASP Projects, the SDLC, and the Security Wayfinder.
Thanks to the OWASP Integration Standards Project for mapping OWASP projects in a diagram of the Software Development LifeCycle. This resource should help you determine which projects fit into your SDLC.

The goal of the Integration Standards project is to facilitate technical interaction between software security initiatives inside OWASP and outside: links between documents and exchange between tools. More interaction reduces fragmentation and complexity of the standard landscape which has been making it hard for developers, testers, and procurement to set and apply appropriate standards and attain a shared understanding.

This project produced three results:

- The Open Common Requirement Enumeration or OpenCRE: a revolutionary mechanism to link standards and guidelines together on multiple levels of topics, providing a harmonized resource for requirements, testing strategies, tool rules, countermeasures, and links to existing repositories of threats and weaknesses. OpenCRE is live at opencre.org. Where all standards come together: https://opencre.org/
- The Security wayfinder (see below): an interactive overview of OWASP projects and how they are related: **OWASP - Application Security Wayfinder Integration Standards.png**
- A study of OWASP in the SDLC: https://owasp.org/www-project-integration-standards/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/

## OWASP Application Security Fragmentation
1. The Software Development LifeCycle and You

    1.1. Planning aka Requirements Gathering & Analysis

    1.2. Design Stage

    1.3. Development Stage

    1.4. Testing Stage

    1.5. Release Stage

2. The In-Between Stage

3. Conclusion

Security doesnâ€™t have to be hard. By following well established guidelines and using well known solutions an organisation can achieve a good level of security without too much resource allocation.

Below is a diagram summarising tools used at each stage of development: **https://owasp.org/www-project-integration-standards/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/images/summary.png**
