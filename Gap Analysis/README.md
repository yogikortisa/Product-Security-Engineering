https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-devsecops-verification-standard

The OWASP DevSecOps Verification Standard (DSOVS) is an open source framework that defines baseline requirements for any software project or organisation. You can use the DSOVS for:

üßê Gap Analysis

DSOVS can be used to identify gaps that exist within a single or multiple software projects by providing internal or external analysts' with a clearly defined standard that cover all areas of the secure software development lifecycle.
üó∫Ô∏è Maturity Roadmap

DSOVS can be used by developers, architects, security people and anyone else to identify existing DevSecOps maturity levels whilst mapping a clear path to work towards heightened maturity.
‚ö†Ô∏è During Third-party Risk Asessments

DSOVS can be used to audit the software development lifecycle (SDLC) maturity of third-parties which is important as it ensures that their software development processes are resilient and helps identify any potential vulnerabilities that exist due to people, processes or software.
